# Insights-into-SARS-CoV-2-Mutational-Dynamics-and-Evolution

Mutation Impact Analysis Report: This file presents the results from a comprehensive analysis of 19,375 SARS-CoV-2 mutation sequences, encompassing 1,774 unique mutations. Utilising a number of predictive models, we have systematically evaluated the potential functional impacts of these mutations. The detailed predictions offer insights into the mutations' roles in viral behavior, aiding in the understanding of SARS-CoV-2's adaptability and evolution.

Lineage Data Integration Report: This file encapsulates the findings from merging validated mutation data with current lineage information sourced from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information. It highlights significant trends in the evolution and dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. A key discovery is the correlation between mutations carrying higher AP scores and their presence in multiple variants, underscoring their potential role in the virus's increased transmissibility and ability to evade vaccine-induced immunity.
